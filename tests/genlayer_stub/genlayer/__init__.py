"""
Minimal offline stub of the `genlayer` SDK.

THIS IS A TEST-ONLY SHIM, NOT PART OF THE DEPLOYABLE CONTRACT.

The real GenLayer SDK (`genlayer` package + GenVM runtime) is only
available inside a GenLayer node / GenLayer Studio / testnet, and
provides trustless, consensus-checked implementations of web access,
LLM calls, the caller's cryptographic identity, and the
equivalence-principle voting protocols.

For fast, fully offline unit testing of ForexCrossRateOracle's
DETERMINISTIC logic (domain extraction, rate parsing, timing windows,
party binding, verdict aggregation), this stub reproduces just enough
of the SDK's surface area to import and exercise `contract.py` in
plain Python, with `gl.nondet.web.render` / `gl.nondet.exec_prompt`
monkeypatched per test case and `gl.message.sender_address` settable
per test case to simulate different callers.

It intentionally does NOT attempt to simulate:
  - real network access,
  - real LLM behavior,
  - multi-validator consensus / leader rotation, or
  - GenVM's real deterministic clock (this stub simply uses the host
    machine's system clock via `datetime.datetime.now`, which is fine
    for these tests since they only assert relative ordering/behavior
    around timestamps, never an exact wall-clock value).

Those require the actual GenLayer Studio or testnet - see the
project's README for how the live end-to-end tests were run there.

    (guided by the `principle` argument) to judge whether the leader's

    identical.
